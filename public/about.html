<h1>About Me</h1>
Hello! I’m Harsh Kumar, a first-year engineering student at BIT Bangalore. Originally from Bihar, I’ve always been passionate about technology and innovation. I’m excited to dive into my studies and explore new opportunities in this vibrant city. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me enjoying local cuisine or connecting with friends. Looking forward to the journey ahead!
